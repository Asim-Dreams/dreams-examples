-----------------------------------
    EXAMPLE 2: Embedded ADF
-----------------------------------

This example is meant to introduce the idea of embedding an ADF file directly 
into the DRAL trace. Embedding the ADF simplifies opening trace files within 
Dreams. The Systolic pipline from Example 1 is used.

-----------------------------------
    HOW TO RUN:
-----------------------------------

scons -u
./dreams_test2
dreams dral_trace.drl.gz

-----------------------------------
    IN THIS EXAMPLE:
-----------------------------------
dreams_test2.cpp:
- Server->Comment() call, which writes a string into the trace file.
- Copy the ADF file into a char* array, which is passed into the comment.
- Designate the comment as an embedded ADF by a special magic number 0xadf.
