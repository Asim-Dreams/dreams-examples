    EXAMPLE 3: CPU Pipeline
-----------------------------------

This example is meant to introduce the idea of conditional coloring in 
the ADF. There is a CPU pipeline model which includes instruction and data memory, 
and real execution of instructions. The INSTRUCTION_TOKEN_CLASS handles
creation of DRAL items.

-----------------------------------
    HOW TO RUN:
-----------------------------------

scons -u
./dreams_test3
dreams dral_trace.drl.gz

-----------------------------------
    IN THIS EXAMPLE:
-----------------------------------
instruction.h:
- In the contructor, the ItemTags are set with PC, Opcode information, 
    and the instruction as a string. 

test3_adf.xml:
- Note 4 Tagdescriptors Which are used later in ADF
- Using "If" statements in displayed edges, the item color and shaped is 
    changed depending on the opcode of the instruction.
