    EXAMPLE 6: Multi-core CPU
-----------------------------------

This example is meant to introduce the idea of executeable ADFs, which
are useful to parameterize ADFs. The CPU pipeline model is extended to 
enable a multi-core CPU.

-----------------------------------
    HOW TO RUN:
-----------------------------------

scons -u
./dreams_test6
dreams dral_trace.drl.gz

-----------------------------------
    IN THIS EXAMPLE:
-----------------------------------
dreams_test5.cpp:
- Comment(0x05E7) sets an enviroment variable in Dreams, to facilitate
    passing parameters into the executable ADF. Note that the Comment() 
    functions that set environment variables must be called *before*
    the ADF is embedded
- Write an environmental variable PERFMODEL_NUM_CPUS 
- Embedded adf is actually a perl script. Dreams determines that the ADF
    is executable is the first line of the embedded ADF includes "#!" or ":"

test6.adf.pl:
- Perl script which generates the ADF
- Note that the environment variable PERFMODEL_NUM_CPUS read
- When executed in dreams, dreams reads directly from STDOUT.
