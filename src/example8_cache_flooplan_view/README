    EXAMPLE 4: Cache Floorplan view
-----------------------------------

This example is meant to introduce the idea of displaying a DRAL node 
(in this case, a cache) in a floor plan mode. The CPU pipeline model from 
Example 3 is expanded to include a cache. In Dreams, the cache is visualized 
by displaying the sets along the x-axis and the ways along the y-axis. Time 
is then stepped through using the play buttons in Dreams, such that changes 
to the cache can be visualized. This example includes visualizing the LRU 
bits and hits and misses to the cache. 

-----------------------------------
    HOW TO RUN:
-----------------------------------

make
./dreams_test7
dreams dral_trace.drl.gz

-----------------------------------
    IN THIS EXAMPLE:
-----------------------------------
cache.h:
- Note the creation of two DRAL nodes In the contructor
 -- SetNodeLayout() sets the node to be 2D storage with capacity of ways*sets
- SetNodeTag() is used to update LRU and Hit data 
 -- The index to update (set / way) is passed as a parameter
 -- See Init(), Read(), Write() UpdateLRU()
- CreateAddressTrace() creates an memory access trace which is viewed in Dreams

dreams_test7.cpp:
- The cache size is 4 ways, 8 sets.
 -- ADF also assumes this size.
- Note that the data_cache->Init() is called after server->StartActivity(),
    so that the initial LRU bits can be fed into the trace

test4_adf.xml:
- Inclusion of HIT, LRU, Address, and Set as a Tag of type integer
- Item window displays the memory access (address stream) trace
 -- Clicking on an item gives details about access (creation) time, etc.
- "dreams3" indicates we will use floorplan view. 
 -- There are two tables created for Hits and LRU data
 -- the "<layout>" command specifies two things
    --- the way the first dimension should be displayed (as 1x8), where 
        N * M must be the size of the dimension (8 sets in our example)
    --- the layout of the second dimension, which is "v" for "Vertical", 
        and creates rows of the 1x8 (e.g. ways of the cache are rows)
 - <rule> is used as before to change color and values
  -- note that "letter" is used with "if" statements to display the LRU value

In Dreams:
- Use the play (and other) buttons on the quickbar to step through time.
- Hits: You will initially see misses at various sets in the cache, then hits
- LRU: You will see LRU values for the array change with time.
