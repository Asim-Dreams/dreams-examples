    EXAMPLE 5: Instruction Dependency Stalls
-----------------------------------

This example is meant to introduce the idea of displaying DRAL item 
dependencies in the trace. The CPU pipeline model from Example 4 is 
used. When an instruction cannot be scheduled due to a dependency with 
the currently executing instruction, that DRAL item is annotated. When
viewed in Dreams, if desired the 


-----------------------------------
    HOW TO RUN:
-----------------------------------

make
./dreams_test5
dreams dral_trace.drl.gz

-----------------------------------
    IN THIS EXAMPLE:
-----------------------------------
instruction.h:
- Function SetDependency(instr) sets which instruction is causing the current 
    instruction to stall. This function is called in dreams_test5.cpp
- The tag "ANCESTOR" is a key word which signifies the dependency 
- Note that SetItemTag must have a setofvalues (array) passed as a parameter, in 
    order to get the dependency working.

test5_adf.xml:
- Inclusion of ANCESTOR as a Tag of type setofvalues

Dreams: 
- To show the dependency edge of a stalled instruction in the Schedule stage, 
    Right click the stalled instruction -> Event Tools -> Relationship Scan
