    EXAMPLE 7: ADF embedded in C++
-----------------------------------

This example is meant to introduce the idea of embedding the entire text
of the adf file in a .cpp file. In this case the perl script adf2c converts
the xml adf into a .cpp file with a routine add_adf() that adds the adf file
into the trace. Otherwise the example is the same as Example 3.

    HOW TO RUN:
-----------------------------------

make
./dreams_test7
dreams dral_trace.drl.gz
